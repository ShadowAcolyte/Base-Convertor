# Base Convertor
A python script for converting between any two bases of numbers. Can also display unicode text for corresponding numbers

I mainly made this project to help out in cryptography challenges and other puzzles involving text encoded as digits in different bases.

# TODO:
~~* Add a way of storing the output in a file instead of printing to the command line
